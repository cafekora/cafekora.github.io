The origin of the kora is surrounded in legend and folklore; with many different stories about when it first came into 
existence.  The kora is just one of the instruments used within Jali families of the Mande people in West Africa – found 
in Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Senegal and the Gambia.

Jali are also referred to as ‘griots’ but this is a French word and the term ‘jali’ is often preferred.  The kora is part 
of an oral tradition,  passed down through family generations.  Children in Jali families grow up with the history, the 
stories and the music and begin to learn an instrument at a young age.  These stories and songs tell the tales of great 
warriors, of Kings, of Jalis themselves and of the patrons who supported them.

The Jali families of West Africa are themselves a hereditary caste of musicians from within the Mande people and are more 
than musicians; they are praise-singers, genealogists and historians, playing a crucial role within the society and part 
of every important event such as birth, marriages and burials.

The kora, the balafon and the ngoni are among the instruments played. It seems to be agreed by most that the kora, the 
last of the three instruments to appear, did not come become used widely across the region until the end of the 1700s; until 
then it is was only seen in the small Mandinka areas on the coast.  Whilst the kora is a large part of the history and culture 
of Mali for example, it did not originate from there. For example, one of the most celebrated kora players in the world today 
is the Toumani Diabate who has helped to bring Mali and the kora to an international audience. His father, Sidiki Diabate, 
was born in The Gambia and moved to Mali as a child.  The whole region has always been more fluid than the country borders 
suggest.

The advent of recorded music has had a major impact on the role of the Jali, but has also enabled the music to travel far and 
wide.  A number of musicians have helped make it more widely-known throughout the world, expanded its repertoire and developed 
diverse styles associated with different areas.
