This page provides links to other interesting and useful websites for lovers of the kora.

* **Kora-music.com**
German language (but with partial translations into English, French & Spanish), this website has a great deal of information 
for kora players. In particular, it is the homepage of the *Jaliya* software, which offers more than 100 fully notated 
transcriptions of famous kora pieces, a valuable resource for those learning to play.

* **Chants Histoire Mande**
Interesting French website (but with an English translation available) which provides a detailed discography, biographies of musicians and a lot of background behind pieces in the Jali repertoire.

* **Mandebala**
Devoted not to the kora, but the bala, it's nonetheless a very useful and interesting resource, put together by ethnomusicologist Todd Martin as part of his PhD.

* **Dennis Havlena**
Dennis Havlena is an American who makes (and modifies) a wide range of musical instruments. His website provides many plans and instructions for home manufacture of koras and ngonis, including details of how to source a resonator from IKEA, if a suitable calabash cannot be obtained!
