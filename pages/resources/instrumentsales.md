* **Koras Kaëlig** (France)
Manufacturer  of a number of different types of koras, with a range of customisation options.

One option is to include “levers” which allow the player to instantly change the pitch of a string by a half-tone, allowing rapid changing between the different tuning systems for the kora. They also sell cases and a foldable stand for the kora and make and sell kamélés n'gonis and bolons. Kaëlig koras are used in concert by many top players.

* **Kora by Cooper** (France)
Makers of semi-acoustic travel koras (the gourd resonator is not required as each string has a pick-up and the sound is produced by an amplifier. The small size, lower weight and lack of animal products allow the instrument to be transported by airplane (the bridge can also be folded down.) The electronic nature of the kora also allows for “quiet” practice, for example with headphones.
