The music of the kora is part of an oral tradition and as such, had no need for a written musical notation system. 
It is possible to notate kora music using the standard western classical system, but doing so can be somewhat unsatisfactory, 
as it does not allow easy annotation of kora playing techniques.

Another method is to use a representation of the kora bridge and strings, which allows the musician to see the interaction of 
the index finger and thumb on each hand for a better representation of kora playing technique. 

One can also use a form of tablature, but most musicians will learn by listening and memorizing, albeit possibly helped by a 
mobile phone or recording device. This method of careful listening, repetition and rote learning is common to nearly all folk 
musics and has several advantages. Learning by listening carefully to a teacher allows subtle phrasing and technique to be 
acquired - things which cannot easily be expressed in written form. 

The ability to learn “by ear” allows the player to use recordings to learn new songs or variations, in the absence of a teacher.
