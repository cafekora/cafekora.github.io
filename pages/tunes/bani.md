Bani Le (or just Bani) is a very good piece for beginners on the kora to tackle. Its kumbengo is simple and a stripped down form can be learnt very quickly. However, it’s also easy to use Bani to demonstrate how a kumbengo can be varied.
On this page, we show the music in three different forms - staff notation (written one octave higher than played, to avoid lots of ledger lines), a kora bridge diagram and tablature. There's also a (synthesised) mp3 of each variant. 

At its most basic, Bani can be broken down into a sequence of 8 evenly spaced notes. The very simplest way to play it is to simply use 4 strings on the right hand side. 




Take some time to get that sequence absolutely solid and repeatable and sounding musical.

Now, let’s introduce some variation.

First of all, we can try doubling the D note (playing the note twice quickly in succession in the same time that we previously played it once.) We can do the same with the G note, or both. That gives us 4 possible variations of the same kumbengo. Play about with that, trying to keep in time and to switch back and forth between the different variations.

Now, we can also try playing the D and G notes using other strings.





We have been playing the D note as the 7th string on the right hand side, but D can also be played as the 3rd string on the
left, or as the 7th string on the left. Try first one and then the other. 

Similarly, we’ve played the G note as the 5th string on the left hand side, but it can also be played as the 5th note on the left, (or indeed as the 9th string on the right.)  Try different variations of playing the G on the left, on the right, both at the same time, or one then the other.

We can also add octaves. So, whenever you play the F note (1st string on the right hand side), you can also play the lower F (1st string on the left hand side.) Get comfortable doing this, as it’s a very common thing to do on the kora. You can also add a higher F (the 8th left hand string), or even play the F in 4 places by adding the 8th right hand string.

You can take this a step further by playing the octave notes slightly apart from each other. This takes a little practice, so you may need to slow the piece right down again. Each time you play the F-A sequence (1st and 2nd strings on the right hand side), we’ll add another A - the 9th string on the left hand side.

Note that because the music is cyclical, it doesn’t matter which one of those 8 notes we start on. This means that similarly, when notating the music, we can start anywhere. This can sometimes cause a little bit of confusion for beginners.

For example, the video by Andrea here:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5FtMy5dCJA>

Essentially treats the 8 note sequence as F-A-G-A-F-A-D-A

Whereas the video from zkora here:<https://vimeo.com/125132034>

Shows the 8 note sequence as F-A-D-A-F-A-G-A

Both are correct - they’ve simply chosen a different F as the starting point. ]
