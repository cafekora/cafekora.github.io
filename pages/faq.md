## FAQs

## About the kora.
-What are the origins of the kora?

The Jali have lots of traditional stories and oral history about how they first got the kora. Most of these involve djinns (genies, if you prefer.) The historical evidence suggests that it probably evolved from similar, less complex instruments, in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries.

-Which countries is the kora played in?

Originally, the kora was played in those areas where Mande culture (descended from the old Mali Empire of the 13th - 17th century AD) is found. That corresponds to the modern day nations of Mali, Guinea, Senegal, The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau and perhaps also the Ivory Coast. Today, of course, you can find people playing kora all over the world.

-Why is the kora said to be a Mande (or Manding) instrument?

It's traditionally associated with the Jali, a class of hereditary oral historians, praise singers and musicians, found across the Mande (also called Manding, Mandinka or a bunch of similar names.) The Mande peoples speak a range of languages and live in several different countries. Traditionally, only a man born into a Jali (also spelled and pronounced Jeli, or Djeli) family can play the kora.

-Can the kora have more than 21 strings?

Yes. Koras sometimes have additional bass strings (particularly those of musicians from Casamance, the southern part of Senegal.) Of course, some people have made modified koras with many more strings.

-What is the difference between a kora and a ngoni

There are several instruments which use the name ngoni. The "jali" ngoni is

-Is a kora with guitar tuners a traditional kora?

Well, that depends on who you ask!

-How many songs are there in the traditional repertoire?

There are around 200, some of which are several hundred years old, but some are of much recent (20th century) origin. No one individual will play all of those songs and many pieces are clearly derived from others, while many songs are played in different ways by different people. 

-Who are the great kora players?

See the musicians page here, for some answers, but I think Toumani Diabate would 

-Are there many ways to play the kora?

On this website, we mainly focus on traditional kora playing and the West African (Mande) repertoire. However, the monks of Keur Mousa Abbey in Senegal have used the kora to accompany Gregorian chant for many decades and people are using the kora to play Jazz, Reggae and many other modern styles of music and there are modern classical pieces written for kora. So it is by no means the case that there is only one way to play.

## Learning to play.
-Can I find a kora teacher in my area?

See the resources section of this website. Many teachers will offer lessons over the internet.

-How long does it take to learn to play kora?

How long does it take to learn any musical instrument? To pick out a familar tune (for example, Happy Birthday) might not take very long, but a lifetime would probably not be enough to reach the virtuosity of Toumani Diabate!

-Do you need to be a Jali to learn or teach kora?

Traditionally, only a Jali would learn kora, and they would only learn from another Jali, usually within their extended family. Many Jali today are very happy to teach kora to outsiders and see it as a way to pass on their culture and the history of their people's heroes and to adapt to the modern world.

-Do you need to know music theory to learn play kora?

Not at all, as kora has historically been learned by listening and repetition, rather than by written notation. Nevertheless, it can add something to your understanding and enjoyment if you know a little about scales and modes.

-Why do kora players only use the two index fingers and two thumbs?

Playing 4 notes at once and coping with polyrhythms is already complicated enough! The remaining fingers are used to hold the kora.

-Is the traditional way of playing kora fixed, or does it change over time?



-Can someone who doesn't play another instrument learn to play the kora?

Yes, playing the kora doesn't require any previous knowledge of another instrument.

-Does it help to know the harp or some other instrument to learn the kora?

There are no real transferable skills from the harp, or other instruments - even the way of producing a note from the string is different on the harp. Of course, if you already know another instrument, you will have some existing listening skills, know how to practice and perhaps some knowledge of how music works. So your brain is already wired to help you learn a new instrument!

-Is it better to buy a kora with guitar tuners or one with traditional rings (donso)?

That is a matter of opinion!

-How often do the strings of a kora need to be changed?

Usually only when they break. On a guitar, mandolin or similar instrument, you may find that strings become "dull" over time and need to be changed, but this doesn't seem to happen so readily on the kora.

-Does a kora go out of tune easily?

Once it's been set up and the strings and everything else have settled, I don't think it's any worse than other stringed instruments. Obviously, anything which is made from organic components such as 

-Do I need to have an electronic tuner?
