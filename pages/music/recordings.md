   <br>
   <p><b>Toumani Diabaté</b> Kaira.</p>
   <br> Recorded in 1987, this was the first solo kora recording. The notes to the album point out that there is no overdubbing or double tracking. It was hard for listeners to believe that only a single musician was playing. A groundbreaking release.

alt="Toumani Diabate The Mandé Variations" width="300" height="225" border="5">
   <p><b>Toumani Diabaté</b> The Mandé Variations</p>
   <br>Another solo album from Toumani on which he plays traditional tunes and his own compositions. He also uses both a traditional instrument which belonged to his father and a kora with machine-head tuners, using the latter with some unusual minor key tunings.

    <p><b>Sona Jobarteh</b> Fasiya</p>
</div>
   <br>A really beautiful recording from the Anglo-Gambian Sona Jobarteh. In addition to playing the kora and singing, she plays other instruments and her band is superb.

    <p><b>Seckou Keita</b> 22 Strings</p>
    <br>Originally from Casamance, but now resident in the UK, this solo album features his own compositions as well as traditional songs and he both sings and plays kora. The title is a reference to the extra bass string often found on koras in Casamance.
