		<h3>About the Kora Caf√©</h3>
		<p> I've loved the Kora since first hearing Toumani Diabate when I was at school. Since then, I've bought a lot of CDs, been to a lot of concerts, watched a lot of YouTube and finally decided to buy a kora and learn how to play. I've been a little frustrated at the lack of Kora information on the web, so decided to do something about it.
