Seckou Keita's new album, African Rhapsodies, has been released on the Swiss record label, Claves. Details here: <https://www.claves.ch/products/african-rhapsodies>

It's an orchestral suite, combining his kora with the BBC Concert Orchestra strings. The track Simply Beautiful Miro, has a certain amount of airplay on BBC Radio. It 
features cellist Abel Selaocoe duetting with the kora and is pretty representative of the album. You can hear it here, on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JRSmDb45vc>
