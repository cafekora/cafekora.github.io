The BBC showed a programme about the making of a kora, which is well worth catching. It's available on their iPlayer online viewer (for a year or so) but unfortunately only for viewers in the UK.

You can access it here: <https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000m2dj/handmade-in-africa-series-1-2-kora>
