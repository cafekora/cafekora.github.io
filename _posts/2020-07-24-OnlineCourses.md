Kora player Vincent Wilkin has created an online kora course. I haven't tried it myself, but it costs 39 Euros and is available at 

<https://vincentwilkin.podia.com/korateacherbeginnercourse>

Vincent is a Belgian musician, who has recently been using the kora to play music from India - both Carnatic and Bollywood. His website is here

After many years of his excellent videos being freely available online, Andrea has decided to take his many kora tuition videos off youtube and available only through a one-time payment of 180 euros. 

More details at <http://koralessons.com/>

This includes a lot of lessons and seems a very reasonable price. Sadly, it seems that Andrea won't be continuing to play kora, or to create further videos.
