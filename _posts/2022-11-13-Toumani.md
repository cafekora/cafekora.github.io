Toumani Diabate's Album - Toumani, Family and Friends is available at various streaming sites: <https://toumanidiabate.lnk.to/ToumaniFamilyFriends>

Quite a mix of musical styles, perhaps reflecting the number of guest stars (friends) appearing, including balafon player Néba Solo on the ballad "Life" and 
the song "Yako" with Fatoumata Diawara. Ivorien Meiway, best known for the Zoblazo style features on "Nadine Sankaré". Family includes his son Sidike.
