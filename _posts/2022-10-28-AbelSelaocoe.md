Abel Selaocoe, Seckou Keita & Chineke! Orchestra will appear at London's Royal Festival Hall on Friday 12th May 2023

They have co-written a double concerto which aims to bring together the music of Senegal, Selaocoe's South African roots and Europe, and the sounds of the cello and kora.

The work has been co-commissioned by Orchestre national de Bretagne, Ulster Orchestra and the Southbank Centre
